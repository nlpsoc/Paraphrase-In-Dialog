**Annotation** data.

`Paraphrase Annotations` includes the annotations done by crowd-workers. You probably only want to look at https://huggingface.co/datasets/AnnaWegmann/Paraphrases-in-Interviews though.

`Paraphrase Candidates` includes the lead author annotations that were used to select datapoints for crowd annotation.

`Pilots` includes legacy Qualtrics study result files of pilot rounds. This is not maintained in this repo. Setup and questions were different then. And current evaluation scripts might not work on these anymore.
